========

A simple web-based HTML editor.

Current features include:
* Ability to download created code
* Function to open code in a new tab
* Option to add basic HTML layout (&lt;html&gt;, &lt;body&gt; etc)

A demo of this is available [here](http://html.danr.uk/), and will update as soon as this repo does.
